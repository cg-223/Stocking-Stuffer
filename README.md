# Welcome to Stocking Stuffer!
## A small Balatro modjam mod about opening presents

Here's a short refresher of how you will participate in this mod:

1. Make a fork of this repo. You will not be able to push edits otherwise

2. You are to make 1 present and 5 Present Fillers
  - The player can hold onto an infinite number of Present Fillers
  - Present Fillers have the unique property of triggering twice, once before and once after Joker calculations
  - Present Fillers can also optionally be consumables if you so choose
  - It is recommended you choose between scoring or consumable, not using both
  - Present Fillers can also have negative effects if you so choose, but this is not required
  - A template file is provided for you to derive from

3. You are not allowed to change `main.lua`. If you require something to be changed, please contact an event organizer

4. Once you are finished making your additions, create a Pull Request to the original repo!
  - Your PR should contain the following:
    - One `.lua` file containing your objects. The filename should include your username
    - Optional `.toml` files for your lovely patches. The filenames should include your username
      - Note: If lovely 0.9.0 is out, you are allowed to store your `.toml` files in folders
    - Whatever asset files you may have created. There is no limit here, but please be respectful
  - The PR title should also contain your username
  - You are not allowed to view Pull Requests from other participants. No peeking at your Christmas presents!

5. You have until December 15th to complete these tasks

### Have a happy holiday!
